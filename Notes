Starting to feel better.

Picked my bike up from REI. The brakes are working now, so hopefully won’t die next time.

Took Aiden to the pool. He didn’t seem to want to get in this time. He just wanted to sit on the side 
and kick his feet. Maybe he’s not feeling great either.

Looks like I might be getting sick again. Shoot. I guess this is what happens when you have
a baby in daycare and they get everything under the sun. Or maybe I need to eat more vegitables. 

Thinking of starting a nonprofit STEM Kids club with my nieces and nephew. 

Find out from Boeing if this is ok.
