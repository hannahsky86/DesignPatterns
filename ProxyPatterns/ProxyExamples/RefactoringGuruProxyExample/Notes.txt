Proxy Pattern

This pattern allows you to control access to the object doing the work
It also lets you directly access the methods in the object doing the work through
the proxy
A proxy represents the object doing the work and may do some work of its own

Do use this pattern
1. Create your object that does the work
2. Create an interface with the same methods as the object
3. Create a proxy that implements the interface
4. Pass a reference to the object to the proxy
5. In the proxy methods call the methods of the object
